# Shop Management System

This work is for short semester in my sophomore year. This project contains a database(EER model and dataset), and a java program for database operation. 
I only have 4 days to complete it, because I will go to UC Berkeley for summer session. I have to stay at library whole day and keep coding, sometime I even have no food to eat. Also, I can hardly go to sleep. 
Maybe this system is not that perfect, but I did all I can within 4 days. I was proud of this project

## How to use it?
### Create database
- use ShopWeb.mwb
### Insert data
- import *.csv through MySQL work branch
- use MySQL commond line insert data in *.txt
- create an administrator account for yourself
### Run java program
